### Just a sidenote ✉
I value keeping this site open source, but as you all know, plagiarism is bad. I spent a non-negligible amount of effort developing, designing, and trying to perfect this iteration of my website, and I am proud of it! All I ask is to not claim this effort as your own.

So, feel free to fork this repo. If you do, please just give me proper credit by linking back to my website.
